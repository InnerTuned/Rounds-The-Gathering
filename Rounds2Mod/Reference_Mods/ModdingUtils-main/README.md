## More Efficient Draws
-----------------------

This mod automatically uses a _significantly_ more efficient algorithm for drawing cards from the deck. This is practically necessary since it can be possible for a significant fraction of the deck to be invalid (rarities set to 0, incompatible with players' current cards, etc.). This algorithm has been tested and verified to produce identical draws to the vanilla game's algorithm.
